```

This version will:
- Render perfectly on GitHub with proper headings, spacing, and code blocks.
- Use emoji icons to make sections visually clear.
- Keep links clickable and formatting clean.
- Maintain GitHub-friendly text wrapping.

If you want, I can also make a **badges section** at the top to make it look more like a trending GitHub project. That could make it stand out more.
